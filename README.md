## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Go 1.21 or later
- OpenSSL (for certificate generation)
- Make (optional, for build automation)

### 1. Setup and Build
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/iamgaru/gander.git
cd gander

# Setup project (creates config.json, directories)
make setup

# Build the binary
make build

# Run tests to verify everything works
make test

# Or use the traditional Go build
go build -o build/gander .
```

### 2. Generate CA Certificate (for HTTPS inspection)
```bash
# Generate self-signed CA for testing
make gen-ca

# Or manually with OpenSSL
openssl genrsa -out certs/ca.key 4096
openssl req -new -x509 -days 365 -key certs/ca.key -out certs/ca.crt \
    -subj "/C=US/ST=CA/L=San Francisco/O=Gander Proxy/CN=Gander Proxy CA"
```

### 3. Configure and Run
```bash
# Edit config.json with your specific rules and settings
nano config.json

# Run the proxy
make run

# Or run the binary directly
./build/gander config.json
```

### 4. Test the Proxy
```bash
# Test HTTP (explicit mode)
curl -x localhost:8080 http://example.com

# Test HTTPS with custom CA (explicit mode)
curl -x localhost:8080 --cacert certs/ca.crt https://example.com
```

## Configuration

### Basic Settings
```json
{
  "proxy": {
    "listen_addr": ":8080",          // Proxy listen address
    "transparent": true,              // Enable transparent mode
    "explicit_port": 3128,           // Port for explicit proxy mode
    "buffer_size": 32768,            // Buffer size for data copying

  }
}
```

### Certificate Management
```json
{
  "tls": {
    "cert_file": "certs/proxy.crt",     // Proxy server certificate
    "key_file": "certs/proxy.key",      // Proxy server private key
    "ca_file": "certs/ca.crt",          // CA certificate for signing
    "ca_key_file": "certs/ca.key",      // CA private key
    "cert_dir": "certs",                // Directory for generated certs

    "valid_days": 365                   // Certificate validity period
  }
}
```

### Logging Configuration
```json
{
  "logging": {
    "log_file": "proxy.log",         // Main log file
    "capture_dir": "captures",       // Directory for HTTP captures
    "max_file_size_mb": 100,         // Max log file size
    "enable_debug": false            // Enable debug logging
  }
}
```

### Inspection Rules
```json
{
  "rules": {
    "inspect_domains": [             // Domains to inspect
      "example.com",
      "api.example.com",
      "*.suspicious.com"
    ],
    "inspect_source_ips": [          // Source IPs to inspect

      "10.0.0.0/24"
    ],
    "bypass_domains": [              // Domains to bypass
      "update.microsoft.com",
      "*.google.com"
    ],

      "192.168.1.1",
      "10.0.1.0/24"
    ]
  }
}
```

## Deployment Modes

### Transparent Mode (Production)

For transparent interception, configure iptables to redirect traffic:

```bash
# Create custom chain for proxy rules
iptables -t nat -N GANDER_PROXY

# Redirect HTTP traffic
iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 80 -j GANDER_PROXY
iptables -t nat -A GANDER_PROXY -d 127.0.0.0/8 -j RETURN
iptables -t nat -A GANDER_PROXY -p tcp -j REDIRECT --to-port 8080

# Redirect HTTPS traffic
iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 443 -j GANDER_PROXY
iptables -t nat -A GANDER_PROXY -d 127.0.0.0/8 -j RETURN
iptables -t nat -A GANDER_PROXY -p tcp -j REDIRECT --to-port 8080

# Allow proxy to access internet (replace 'gander-user' with actual user)
iptables -t nat -A OUTPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -m owner --uid-owner gander-user -j ACCEPT
iptables -t nat -A OUTPUT -p tcp --dport 443 -m owner --uid-owner gander-user -j ACCEPT
```

### Explicit Mode (Testing)

Configure clients to use the proxy:
- HTTP Proxy: `localhost:8080`
- HTTPS Proxy: `localhost:8080`
- Install CA certificate in browser/system

### Docker Deployment

```dockerfile
FROM golang:1.24-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN make build-prod

FROM alpine:latest
RUN apk --no-cache add ca-certificates iptables
WORKDIR /root/
COPY --from=builder /app/build/gander .
COPY config.json .
COPY certs/ certs/
EXPOSE 8080
CMD ["./gander", "config.json"]
```

## Certificate Management

### Using Custom CA

1. **Generate CA Certificate**:
```bash
make gen-ca
```

2. **Configure Auto-Generation**:
Set `auto_generate: true` in the TLS configuration to automatically generate certificates for new domains.

### Client Certificate Installation

**Chrome/Chromium**:
1. Go to Settings ‚Üí Privacy and security ‚Üí Security ‚Üí Manage certificates
2. Import `certs/ca.crt` as a trusted root certificate

**Firefox**:
1. Go to Settings ‚Üí Privacy & Security ‚Üí Certificates ‚Üí View Certificates
2. Import `certs/ca.crt` in the Authorities tab

**System-wide (Linux)**:
```bash
sudo cp certs/ca.crt /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/gander-proxy.crt
sudo update-ca-certificates
```

**System-wide (macOS)**:
```bash
sudo security add-trusted-cert -d root -r trustRoot -k /Library/Keychains/System.keychain certs/ca.crt
```

## Logging and Monitoring

### Connection Logs
```
[2024-06-21 10:30:45.123] 192.168.1.100 -> example.com:443 (example.com) | 2.345s | 1024/2048 bytes | HTTPS | inspected=true captured=true
```

### HTTP Captures
Inspected HTTP requests are saved as JSON files:
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2024-06-21T10:30:45.123Z",
  "client_ip": "192.168.1.100",
  "domain": "example.com",
  "method": "GET",
  "url": "/api/data",
  "headers": {
    "Host": "example.com",
    "User-Agent": "Mozilla/5.0...",
    "Authorization": "Bearer ..."
  },
  "body": "request body content"
}
```

### Real-time Monitoring
```bash
# View live logs
make logs

# View recent activity
make logs-recent

# Monitor with system tools
tail -f proxy.log | grep "HTTPS"
```

### Statistics
Real-time statistics logged every 30 seconds:
```
Stats: 1250 total, 45 active, 87 inspected, 23 captured, 145 MB transferred
```

## Performance Tuning

### High-Throughput Environments
```json
{
  "proxy": {
    "buffer_size": 65536,           // Larger buffers for better performance
    "read_timeout_seconds": 60,     // Longer timeouts for slow connections
    "write_timeout_seconds": 60
  }
}
```

### Memory Optimization
```bash
# Set Go garbage collector target
export GOGC=100

# Limit maximum goroutines (if needed)
export GOMAXPROCS=4
```

## Security Considerations

1. **Certificate Security**:
   - Keep CA private key secure (`certs/ca.key`)
   - Use strong passwords for certificate files
   - Regularly rotate certificates
   - Restrict file permissions: `chmod 600 certs/ca.key`

2. **Network Security**:
   - Run proxy as non-root user
   - Use iptables to restrict proxy access
   - Monitor logs for suspicious activity
   - Implement rate limiting if needed

3. **Access Control**:
   - Implement IP-based access controls
   - Use VPN for remote management
   - Regular security audits
   - Monitor captured data access

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Build Errors**:
```bash
# Check Go version
go version

# Clean and rebuild
make clean
make build

# Check dependencies
make check-deps
```

**Certificate Errors**:
```bash
# Verify certificate validity
openssl x509 -in certs/ca.crt -text -noout

# Check certificate chain
openssl verify -CAfile certs/ca.crt certs/generated-cert.crt

# Regenerate CA if needed
make clean-all
make gen-ca
```

**Connection Issues**:
```bash
# Check if proxy is listening
netstat -tlnp | grep 8080

# Test connectivity
telnet localhost 8080

# Check proxy logs
make logs-recent
```

**Performance Issues**:
```bash
# Monitor system resources
htop

# Check file descriptor limits
ulimit -n

# Monitor network connections
ss -tuln

# Enable debug logging
# Set "enable_debug": true in config.json
```

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging in configuration:
```json
{
  "logging": {
    "enable_debug": true,
    "log_file": "debug.log"
  }
}
```
